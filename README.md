Blockchain is a immutable ledger, because change in a single block will lead ti corruption of entire blockchain
It is a distributed P2P network. A hacker can get access to multiple people's data by just hacking into a single bank server, but in P2P network if a computer gets hacked still the other computer's data is safe and completely unharmed. 
Everyone has a copy of blockchain and if new blocks gets added it is confirmed by other people. If a hacker hacks into computer A blockchain and also takes care of its corresponding hashes, if a new block is added by another computer B it won't be added to computer A blockchain as the new hash created is not appropriate then computer A might ask the other computers ford their copy and checks it and will get to know that his blockchain was disturbed and will correct it.
